The mental health benefits of meditation include better focus and concentration, improved self-awareness and self-esteem, lower levels of stress and anxiety, and fostering kindness. Meditation also has benefits for your physical health, as it can improve your tolerance for pain and help fight substance addiction.

<b>How to perform?

1) <i>Take a seat</i></b>
Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.

<b>2) <i>Set a time limit</i></b>
If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.

<b>3) <i>Notice your body</i></b>
You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.

<b>4) <i>Feel your breath</i></b>
Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.

<b>5) <i>Notice when your mind has wandered</i></b>
Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.

<b>6) <i>Be kind to your wandering mind</i></b>
Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.

<b>7) <i>Close with kindness</i></b>
When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.

That’s it! That’s the practice. You go away, you come back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible.
