wellbeing as <b>â€˜a positive physical, social and mental stateâ€™</b>. For our purposes, we are focusing on mental wellbeing.

Mental wellbeing does not have a single universal definition, but it does encompass factors such as:

ðŸ‘‰The sense of feeling good about ourselves and being able to function well individually or in relationships
ðŸ‘‰The ability to deal with the ups and downs of life, such as coping with challenges and making the most of opportunities
ðŸ‘‰The feeling of connection to our community and surroundings
ðŸ‘‰Having control and freedom over our lives
ðŸ‘‰Having a sense of purpose and feeling valued
