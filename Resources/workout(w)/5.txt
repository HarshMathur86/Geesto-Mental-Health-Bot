Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. This is because when you breathe deeply, it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax. The brain then sends this message to your body. Breathing exercises are a good way to relax, reduce tension, and relieve stress.

<b>how to perform?</b>
ðŸ‘‰ Sit or lie flat in a comfortable position.
ðŸ‘‰ Put one hand on your belly just below your ribs and the other hand on your chest.
ðŸ‘‰ Take a deep breath in through your nose, and let your belly push your hand out. Your chest should not move.
ðŸ‘‰ Breathe out through pursed lips as if you were whistling. Feel the hand on your belly go in, and use it to push all the air out.
ðŸ‘‰ Do this breathing 3 to 10 times. Take your time with each breath.
ðŸ‘‰ Notice how you feel at the end of the exercise.
