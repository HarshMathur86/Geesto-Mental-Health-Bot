laughter is strong medicine. It draws people together in ways that trigger healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter strengthens your immune system, boosts mood, diminishes pain, and protects you from the damaging effects of stress. Nothing works faster or more dependably to bring your mind and body back into balance than a good laugh.

<b>How to perform?</b>
ðŸ‘‰ Gradient laughter: Fake a smile; giggle, then laugh slowly and gradually increase in tempo and volume. 
ðŸ‘‰ Hearty laughter: Spread the arms up, laugh and direct your laughter to come straight from your heart, bring the arms down and again raise them up.
